Task 1
Write a program that takes an integer and displays its factorization into prime numbers. Assume that the user enters a valid integer number.

Task 2
Write a program that calculates an approximation of the pi number using the Monte-Carlo method. The program should ask the user for the total number of iterations and the step of printing and then display the current approximation after each step number of iterations and then the final value.
